# python-api-challenge

The api-challenge had two Parts. In Part I, I started by running a random request using Latitude and Longitude coordinates with the citipy libaray to create a random city list with 500+ cities. From performed an API call from openweathermap.org to get the weather stats and combined the city list and weather stats to create a dataframe. I used the .describe functions to review the list of cities' count, mean, std, min and max stats for humidty, tempature, cloudiness and wind speed. I filtered out the cities that were outliers, stored the information in the dataframe in a CSV, and created scatter plots for visulazation. 

In Part II, I loaded the CSV from Part I and created a dataframe. I  created a heatmap based on humidity levels. I then defined the ideal weather patterns with a minimum tempature of 75, maximum tempature of 85, 1% or less cloud coverage, and less than 10 mph wind speeds. After filtering out any city that did not meet the ideal weather, I was left with 16 cities. 

The highlight of both projects was in Part II, where I performed an API call from gmaps and added hotels within 5k meters from the 16 cities and created a heat map with hotel markers for visulazation.
